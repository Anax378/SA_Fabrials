## Guide:
currently, not all items are obtainable in survival.
please note that this mode is not finished, it might be unstable and is incomplete.

### How to create fabrials:
you can create fabrials by combining a gemstone, a fabrial casing, steel or iron ingot and a number of zinc nuggets in the artifabrians station block.

the strength of the fabrial depends on the number of zinc nuggets added to a maximum of 5 nuggets.
the stormlight capacity of the fabrial will be determined by the type of gemstone used.
the spren will also be determined by the spren caught in the gemstone.
the polarity is decided by providing either **iron** for positive chrge (pull) and **steel ingot** for negative charge (push).

there are two types of casings, a fabrial casing and a thrown fabrial casing. depending on which one of these you put into the recipe, the fabrial you end up with is going to be either activated imidiately after right click, or it will be able to be throw and will activate on impact.

### how to catch spren:
you catch spren using the spren catching station. the first slot is for the bait for the spren. there is a list of baits for every spren which is listed below.
into the second slot you put a gemstone or a fabrial that you intend to catch the spren into, this gemstone or fabrial needs to be **full of stormlight**.
into the third slot you put an **empty** gem or fabrial whose stormlight capacity matches or exceeds that of the first gemstone or fabrial.

immidiately after valid items are placed into their slots, the spren catchings station begins to trasfer stormlight from the full gem to the other and trapping a spren into the first gem or fabrial.
please note that the creative gemstone cannot be used in neither of the slots, the creative gemstone is only used as an infinite source of stormlight.

### how to get stormlight:
the survival methods of obtaining stormlight are not yet implemented. you will have to use the creative gemstone.
you can transfer stormlight between gems or fabrials using the topaz crystal block. in the top slot you can provide stormlight, and in the bottom slot you can drain it.
more types of crystal block will be added in the future.

### how to use the stormlight pipe:
the stormlight pipe tranfers stormlight between crystal blocks. each crystal block has one input and one output.
you can change the direction of the pipe by right-clicking on the part of the pipe that you want to change direction.

### how to use the conjoined redstone lamp block:
the conjoined redstone lamp block can be placed twice using the conjoined redstone lamp item. after being placed, the lanters will always share their LIT/UNLIT state.
the conjoined redstone lamp item will only drop from the first conjoined redstone lamp block you break.

### list of spren and their item baits:

wind spren: feather, elytra <br>
health spren: glistering melon slice <br>
fire spren: flint and steel, fire charge <br>
explosion spren: gunpowder, tnt <br>
lightning spren: lightning rod <br>

(more will certainly be coming in the future)
